# Quantum-Classical Hybrid Cryptography Standards Platform

A decentralized platform for developing, testing, and certifying quantum-resistant cryptographic standards using blockchain technology and smart contracts.

## Overview

This platform provides a comprehensive ecosystem for the collaborative development and certification of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. It combines classical blockchain security with quantum-resistant algorithms to create a future-proof cryptographic standards framework.

### Key Features

- Smart contract-based certification pipeline
- Quantum-resistant algorithm registry
- NFT-based certification system
- Token-based vulnerability reporting incentives
- Integration with quantum key distribution (QKD) systems
- Decentralized governance framework

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Blockchain Layer**
    - Ethereum-based smart contracts for algorithm submissions
    - NFT minting and management system
    - Token economics for platform governance
    - Distributed storage for algorithm implementations

2. **Quantum Integration Layer**
    - Quantum random number generator (QRNG) integration
    - QKD system interfaces
    - Quantum entropy sourcing
    - Post-quantum cryptography testing suite

3. **Certification Framework**
    - Automated testing pipelines
    - Peer review system
    - Vulnerability assessment tools
    - Certification criteria management

4. **Governance System**
    - DAO-based decision making
    - Stakeholder voting mechanisms
    - Certification criteria updates
    - Security parameter adjustment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16.0 or higher
- Hardhat development framework
- OpenSSL 3.0+
- Python 3.9+
- Quantum development kit (QDK)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/quantum-crypto-platform

# Install dependencies
cd quantum-crypto-platform
npm install

# Set up development environment
cp .env.example .env
npm run setup
```

### Configuration

1. Configure your quantum random number generator source in `config/qrng.json`
2. Set up your QKD endpoints in `config/qkd.json`
3. Update smart contract addresses in `config/network.json`
4. Configure governance parameters in `config/dao.json`

## Usage

### Submitting an Algorithm

```javascript
// Example submission using the platform API
const submission = await platform.submitAlgorithm({
    name: "NewQuantumResistant",
    version: "1.0.0",
    specification: "path/to/spec.pdf",
    implementation: "path/to/implementation",
    testVectors: "path/to/test-vectors"
});
```

### Certification Process

1. **Initial Submission**
    - Submit algorithm specification and implementation
    - Provide test vectors and security proofs
    - Pay submission fee in platform tokens

2. **Automated Testing**
    - Security parameter verification
    - Performance benchmarking
    - Quantum resistance assessment

3. **Peer Review**
    - Community review period
    - Expert assessment
    - Vulnerability reporting

4. **Certification**
    - Final security assessment
    - NFT minting
    - Public registry listing

## Token Economics

### Platform Token (QCRYPT)

- Used for governance voting
- Staking for certification requests
- Rewards for vulnerability discovery
- Incentives for peer reviewers

### Certification NFTs

- Represents certified algorithms
- Contains certification metadata
- Transferable ownership
- Version control and updates

## Contributing

### Development Setup

```bash
# Set up development environment
npm run dev:setup

# Run test suite
npm run test

# Deploy local testnet
npm run chain:local
```

## Security

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities through our secure bug bounty program at `security@quantum-crypto-platform.io`. Do not disclose security issues publicly until they have been addressed by the team.

### Security Measures

- Multi-signature requirement for critical operations
- Time-locked upgrades
- Formal verification of smart contracts
- Regular security audits
